# piper.unity

This is the Unity3d port of [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) text-to-speech (TTS) library. It provides fast, local, and high-quality speech generation for multiple languages. Inference is done by using [Unity Sentis](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@latest).

Supports only Windows x86-64.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository and open it as a regular Unity project.
2. Download a `.onnx` model file, such as [en_US-lessac-medium.onnx](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/v1.0.0/en/en_US/lessac/medium/en_US-lessac-medium.onnx)
3. Place it somewhere inside your `Assets` folder. Sentis should automatically transform it into model asset
4. Open `Assets/Piper/Samples/PiperSample` scene in Unity Editor
5. Find `Piper` GameObject and set `PiperManager.Model` field to previously downloaded model 
6. Press Play and test speech generation

You can find more [piper models here](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices). Each model comes with a model card describing the training dataset and license (for example [en_US-lessac-medium model card](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/v1.0.0/en/en_US/lessac/medium/MODEL_CARD)). 

You would also need to set correct the  "voice" (language code) and sample rate for the model. This can be find in json located near the model, like in [en_US-lessac-medium.onnx.json](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/v1.0.0/en/en_US/lessac/medium/en_US-lessac-medium.onnx.json).
